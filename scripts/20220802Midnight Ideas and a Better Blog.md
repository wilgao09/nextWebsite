# A Better Blog

Today's date is August 2nd, 2022. The last *update* to this (my personal site) was in June. Given my activity on this project, I would deem this project dead.

This blog is much too important to belong in a dumpster. The only projects that belong in a dumpster are those that are privated on my Github. 

So how will I ressurect this project from the dumpster? 

## Midnight Ideas

I was talking to a good friend of mine a few days ago when he recommended that I start applying to internships soon (again). This wasn't a problem in previous years because I had nothing other than my resume. My expectations since then have grown and now that I have this prototype for a personal website, I've decided that it would be pretty cool if I could actually put something in the "personal website" field applications always have. 

And so I told him: *I would immediately, but I have a "personal website" that's super unfinished*. He shared similar sentiments, for he, too, had an unfinished website. We're both not frontend people, so we had a good half an hour of pingponging terrible ideas back and forth. At some point, one of the terrible ideas pingpong'd was "since we constantly work in terminal, what if we made a personal website look like terminal?"

This is undoubtedly a terrible idea: the whole point of having a "website" and a "browser", heck, even a "graphical interface", is to get away from the terminal. The objective is to look good, appeal to a wide audience, and be easy to use: why would you ever want to look like terminal?

I, for one, think terminals look cool. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Terminals can definitely be spun to look cool. I'm sure someone thinks that terminals look terrible, but this is my website. 

The next milestone will be me playing around with this website so that it *can* look like a terminal. The plan is to add a button on the (currently bare) home page. The button, when pressed, will rerender every component as a terminal element. Navigation of the website itself will be done exclusively by typing your favorite bash commands (`cd` to navigate into tabs, `ls` to see your options, `cat` a file to read it). Exiting will be pressing an X button in the corner or with an `exit 0`. 

This has definitely been done, so the challenge is that I transform the current website into terminal with as little spaghetti code as I can.
