# Hello World!

This is hte first blog post on this website. The website itself is going to be the subject of many blogs because I am not particularly fond of frontend development and I think it would be funny to chronicle my woes as this is being built. 

As of writing this, the entire website is written in Nextjs/React. The first goal will be to have a working product that doesnt look like utter crap and deploy it to Vercel. 

I do plan on eventually moving making the website dynamic so I can do something like comments. The roadmap after Vercel isnt clear :/.
